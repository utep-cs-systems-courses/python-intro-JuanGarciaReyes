<strong>In this lab, I just created a code that do the following tasks:</strong>

takes as input the name of an input file and output file

<li>keeps track of the total the number of times each word occurs in the text file</li>
<li>excluding white space and punctuationis case-insensitive</li>
<li>print out to the output file (overwriting if it exists) the list of words sorted in descending order with their respective totals separated by a space, one word per line<l\i>
